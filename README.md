# STREAM_ANALYTICS_UI_REACT

I am developing a React.js project for a food delivery dashboard that involves randomly generating data, streaming it through Kafka with Zookeeper for coordination, storing it in an SQL database, and displaying the data using charts on the dashboard. This project showcases real-time data processing and visualization, providing insights into food delivery trends.
